This is not a bad choice for your first place to live at when moving out of the dorms. I really enjoyed the location, amenities & staff members in the office. They do well with communicating unit entry, office closure and maintenance. Since they house a lot of students, there’s a good chance you’ll meet some really cool people. They also have students working the front desk so it’s nice to talk to people your own age. The property manager, Tabbitha, is extremely understanding and I had amazing conversations with her whether it was about the property or just things going on in my life. She really feels like a friend! I want to stress that my review has nothing to do with her skills as a property manager or her as a person (as well as any other of the wonderful staff members I had the pleasure of getting to know) as the issue I am about to describe did not seem to involve her at all but someone who works for/represents State that I have never seen at the physical location before.

Here’s my issue with State on Bloomington and why I cannot give it 5 stars. My roommate paid to have her room and part of the living room cleaned and still got charged a cleaning fee. In the agreement, there is a section that clearly states she did NOT have to “clean all areas of the apartment”. When we emailed corporate to ask about that fee, they said it “only covered her room and not the common area”. If that was the case, that should’ve been stated in the cleaning agreement. So not only did she pay $100 in cleaning fees, she was charged an additional $109 for “1/3 common area cleaning”.

On top of that, they’re charging us a total of $400 for repainting the walls. When we asked them to send pictures of damages that needed repaint, it’s like they didn’t even try to clean the walls first. While there were smudges (due to normal wear and tear) on the wall, it was clear that they took those pictures before cleaning. When I asked for a breakdown of paint and labor, and how it would cost $400, they told us that State needed to do a whole repaint on two of the walls. Let it also be known that we barely decorated the walls of that apartment so there were no holes or paint ripped off from tape.

As a college student, I do not have the time nor money to dispute these charges either legally or just between me and the apartment. I have already contacted State about this and do not wish to go back and forth again just for them to tell me I’m “wrong”. However, I do want to leave this review here for future residents so they are aware of the move out situation. Most of the reviews that have been written are by current residents who have not moved out yet. I also want to note that as a resident, you are incentivized to write reviews in exchange for gift cards or something related. While this does not guarantee good reviews, for a gift card I would definitely be quick to put five stars and a short note that doesn’t really sum up a full experience here as others have. You can really tell by reading some of these reviews. I’m sure this is not the first or only apartment to do this but I thought that was important to note.

All this to say: good place to live, be careful about the move out fees and TAKE PHOTOS OF EVERYTHING UPON MOVE-IN. They will take any chance to charge you for it if you don’t.

**EDIT**
They were able to change the price for my move out fee. Good response to my issues/complaint. I encourage others who have issues with State to continue communicating with them. Originally, I did not want to but I sent one last email in hopes of change. Clearly, it was worthwhile and I respect the staff for listening to my concerns and helping to rectify the issue.",,,,,"We are so pleased to hear that you enjoy living at State on Campus Bloomington!

It's reassuring to know that there's someone like him who genuinely cares about the well-being of the residents.

We had a few guys come in to drill into the wall for whatever reason. Management never sent an email detailing when they would come or what time. They came at 8:30 in the morning while we were asleep and I woke up and left my room to men drilling in there. They said they would have to come back on Friday so I asked them if they could come around 9 and they came at noon. They called me a liar to my face. The leasing employee comes back highlighting in the contract that technically they're allowed to come in anytime. I told them well technically they could just sleep and live here then. She smiled and said yes they could. I also mentioned the email they sent last week stated they would notify each unit when maintenance would happen. She simply responded with a smile and pointed back to the lease saying it's not necessary. She then said: ""I don't have to explain anything to you. It's all in the lease."" And left.

Absolutely ridiculous. I paid $8000 when I first started living here (10 months of rent) and this is how they treat their tenants. Wow.

I decided to renew my lease because the price was good, and that appears to have been a MASSIVE mistake. On the first day of my renewal, I came back to my apartment to find that my key fob suddenly wasn't working. Without any communication from the apartment complex, I learned that my key fob had to be re-activated every lease, and that I would have to wait until the next morning to do so. I had to literally find someplace else to stay the night because of the horrendous lack of communication from this apartment complex.

However, that is not even close to the only situation I've had. My washing machine was broken for 6 and a half weeks before it was finally fixed. The biggest kicker is that they DID NOT COMMUNICATE that their parking permits were expiring UNTIL THE SAME DAY. I got a call during a class (I am a college student) telling me that, if I didn't leave class and bolt to the apartment office that same day before their closing, I would get my vehicle towed. The terrible lines of communication are even worse because of their lack of an emergency phone number. It's just absolutely ridiculous that the new ownership decided to buy this apartment complex when the truth is that they don't appear to be even remotely close to ready to do the basics of what a landlord does. They try to entice new people in with fancy new facilities and fancy giveaways of small prizes every few weeks, but the truth is that this apartment complex is terrible and only seems to be changing for the worse.

If there's one thing to take from this review: Get as far away as you can from this place. It is not good in any definition of the word. Period.",,,,,"Hi Chirayu, thank you for your feedback.

It was the worst possible experience that you could imagine. Our dishwasher and washer/dryer kept breaking constantly. Whenever we needed maintenance to come, it would take about a month just to fix a simple problem. When moving in, my list of problems with the apartment was insanely long. When I moved out, they tried to charge me items that were clearly broken before i moved in and were on the list of problems. Parking is an absolute nightmare. There are never enough spots for people.

The staff is the worst. Whenever I call them about issues, I am directed to someone who is unable to help. The person in charge is never in the office and will never call me back. I emailed the staff with issues and they didn't respond either.

These are not just issues that I have had. Every single one of my friends that stayed here had the same issues.

Everything is pretty low quality. Would not recommend living here if you have a car. Parking is a nightmare, and they change the parking situation constantly specifically for guest parking and you will absolutely get towed if you’re not in the right spot. They are constantly doing construction on the property which proves to be pretty inconvenient at times. If you like to sleep in past 7am don’t live here. There is construction going on right beside the property that goes on from early morning until evening, and aside from that there always seems to be work being done on the property that is extremely loud and disruptive. My biggest complaint is that I can never seem to get any peace & quiet throughout my 1.5 years of living here. Also communication from management is very poor & unorganized. Living expenses here do not match the quality of the living experience. Rent & parking passes are very steep. I thought rent was worth it considering the amenities they had such as a pool but during the 1.5 years i’ve lived here, the pool has been open a total of 1.5-2 months. Also last year I had one of my roommates move out mid-lease unexpectedly and I was told less than 48 hours in advance by my former roommate that I would be getting a new random roommate, and the office didn’t even bother to tell me nor did they have any idea what I was talking about when I asked them.

I am sure you can agree there are two side to every story. The maintenance did not let your dog out on purpose, they were responding to a work order request and your dog was not in its kennel and either saw the door open and ran or two strange men coming in the home and was scared and ran. We know you were upset and took your frustrations out on staff, especially those that lived on site after hours and even during hours while they were on tours. The blonde leasing agent you are referencing is no longer with us but was promoted in our company to a larger property. Please know that just because she did not apologize to you while you were verbally abusing her, after hours on her own time, does not make her a bad employee. We do send out emails 48 hours prior to entering apartments, they are date and time stamped in your system. We do check for damages during the lease, we have to protect and maintain the property, there are time during a lease damages are discovered that have not been reported and need attention. In regards to your unit damages, like you said, you emailed us back and it was corrected. We agree the property does have potential and in the 2018-2019 lease year we are going to see a lot of upgrades to the property. Your experience may not have been excellent but we had a record number of renewals this year and are pre-leasing 23% above last year’s numbers at this time, the numbers show we are certainly doing serval things right.",1521772108.0,03/23/2018 02:28:28,https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNnOUozU2t3RRAB!2m1!1s0x0:0x54817981dac47e66!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgICg9J3SkwE%7CCgsIw-nL1QUQgPDnag%7C?hl=en-US,1,1521677507,03/22/2018 00:11:47,9,6089281769809673830,60,4,8,16,103

Raised parking prices after telling us initially it would be a different amount. Barely enough staff and maintenance to keep up with all the residents. Took away and barely had enough vistors parking so our guests would get towed all the time. We had constant bugs in our aparments along with many issues with the seals on our windows and doors.

They do not prorate anything so do not sign any early termination papers, as I so ignorantly did. Stayed 6 nights and payed FULL months rent.

We have multiple emails in regards to our gift cards saying we will get them and low and behold here we are 2 months later all moved out and nothing. They won’t even have a conversation about them. Erica the property manager is extremely rude. So they got our full rent and our gift card $ and they still expect us to pay for $17 blinds that they will be replacing when they decide to renovate our old apartment..  knights landing.. please do not live there if you have any respect for yourself",,,,,"Hello Mr. Carey,
I am sure your review was prompted by the move out charges emailed yesterday. You are correct, there are no pro-rations on the lease as it is based on monthly payments of equal rental installment. Everyone that took part in the early termination option, released in November, was offered a gift card incentive of $250 per person if they turned the documents in on time as there were limited quantities and spots avaible for that promotion. You would have had multiple emails in the month of January prompting you to turn your paperwork in before the gift cards were all issued and a final email stating the gift cards were all given out. Even the paperwork you signed had a typed in amount of $0.00 for a gift card being issued but still let you out of your lease early. You did not have to take part in the program but you chose too and even signed your documents in front of a notary at $0.00 for a gift card and made the effort to turn it in to the office. We also ask that you not confuse rudeness for having to end a conversation that became hostile on your part as it was the third time the same concerns were addressed and not to your satisfaction, even your roommate had to ask you to stop. We understand our regional manager explained it again a fourth time and this response serves as the fifth response with the same information being explained. We have replied to your email with a picture of your damage blinds and while the apartment is being renovated the blinds are still being used in each renovated apartment as there is no need to convert from that style blind. We hope this helps you in being able to understand.",1528473323.0,06/08/2018 15:55:23,https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNRbTdYYUV3EAE!2m1!1s0x0:0x54817981dac47e66!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgICQm7XaEw%7CCgsIob_m2AUQwKWtVQ%7C?hl=en-US,1,1528405921,06/07/2018 21:12:01,7,6089281769809673830,60,4,8,16,103

Review is long but organized by topic. Enjoy my honesty

OVERVIEW: We lived in a 3bd/2bath 900sqft apartment and honestly, it was small. If the three of us (total strangers upon move-in) didn't get along, I cannot imagine if we would've survived the year. There was little privacy so having friends over basically forced everyone else into their rooms. Small space with all hard floors made it rather loud and reverberant as well. The provided furniture was nice HOWEVER the lease said we would get dressers and we did not. That was the first of many lies told to us by management. We paid $505/month before insurance and electric bill. Since we moved out, I believe rent is over $550/month.

PARKING: They require you to buy a parking pass...fine....but the parking passes are done by calendar year (Jan-Dec) not academic year (Jul-Jun). All of their residents are student.....they only lease to students. This means that we paid $40 in the fall and had to buy another $40 parking pass in January. Additionally, because they keep adding bedrooms, there is a parking shortage so there is no guarantee you'll get a pass. Residents always park in the visitor spots so don't try to invite people over either.

KITCHEN: The kitchen was the best feature of the apartment although glass cooktops are a pain to keep clean. As are pure white countertops. Cannot keep it clean to save our lives. Cabinet space was sparse so we had to buy a large metal shelving unit for food storage. Appliance were wonderful and, at the price we paid (rates have since dramatically increased), it was a steal.

INSULATION/HEAT/AC: This place was freezing and wildly inefficient. The windows could not be made of thinner glass and the walls probably have half the insulation they really need. The air handler is located in a bedroom closet so whoever sleeps there (me) has a constant hum in the winter. Also, if you don't keep that cabinet door closed, it was actually quite loud. If you live on a bottom unit, perhaps you should buy your upstairs neighbors some nice slippers so you can't hear their every step.

LAUNDRY: (in-unit) I hated the laundry set up. Due to the location of the machine and the apartment acoustics, if anyone was doing laundry, don't try and watch tv or have a conversation.

<3 MAINTENANCE MAN <3 : This man is why we are giving it 3 stars instead of 2.  We don't know his name, but he is the only quality human employed by the leasing office. Nicest guy. Always pleasant. Prompt. Once we put in a maintenance request for a quick fix. He showed up and, upon noticing other little issues, went back to the office for more supplies and fixed two other things without being asked. Consistently went above and beyond in his work. I would see him picking up trash in the mornings. We love Maintenance Man

MANAGEMENT: Um well they were annoying and disorganized and didn't respect the tenants. We were pawns in their establishment not residents. They lied/omitted information a lot: we never got a gym; we went most of the year without proper blinds but were never told if/when we would get them; don't rely on them to email you if you get a package.
Over the summer, they renovated units but didn't warn the residents still living there. I personally endured consecutive days of hearing jack hammers in every unit around me. It was unbearably loud.
When one roommate moved out for the summer, she re-leased it. However, office being discombobulated, they repeatedly left eviction notices for her even though she signed papers to re-lease and didn't even live there anymore.",,,,,,,,https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQwdmJiazF3RRAB!2m1!1s0x0:0x54817981dac47e66!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgID0vbbk1wE%7CCgwIovjC7gUQqOSHoQE%7C?hl=en-US,3,1573960738,11/17/2019 03:18:58,4,6089281769809673830,60,4,8,16,103

The apartment was perfect for a first apartment by myself. There were a couple times I needed help with something quickly, once after the office had already closed but I had just happened to get ahold of somebody and they went so far out of their way to get everything taken care of for me, which meant so much considering my last apartment (between times living here) didn’t give a care about their tenants or the quality of their apartments they leased out. My apartment was so nice and I never had any issues within the apartment as far as living conditions. They only thing I would complain about is that some of other pet owners in the complex are absolutely horrible about picking up after their dogs, but obviously that is at fault of those tenants who aren’t responsible enough to take on that smelly part of owning an animal, not the complex staff. When I did talk to the office about it they began looking out more for tenants who weren’t following the pet waste policy and leaving notes with pet waste baggies on their doors to remind them to pick up after their pets. The office staff were always so happy and upbeat when I came in, and if you’re lucky you’ll get some puppy love from one of their dogs when she comes in to work with one of the girls :)",,,,,"Thank you for your kind words, Sam!

The staff has always been incredibly friendly and puts on events frequently (usually involving free food and stuff so that's always fun). The only utilities you have to pay is electricity, but you are forced to buy through Duke Energy, which I'm convinced artificially inflates the price, usually ends up at about $130/month and worse in winter. In terms of the actual apartments the two bedrooms were very spacious for the price, even though they weren't the most modern. Now they're renovating all of those 2 bedrooms into 3 bedrooms and are charging over $100 more/month for them! The new apartments are modern and have to be furnished, but now what choice does that leave current residents who can't afford that new price and already have a bunch of furniture? The complex is in the middle of being gentrified, forcing residents to pay up or move out next May. Hard to ethically support a place that screws over its clients like that.",,,,,"Hi Abigail,
Thank you for your review and your kind words about the staff and our efforts. Trust me we have our own concerns with Duke Energy at times, just as the residents pay their unit electric we pay common area lights and track the fluctuation which we have called many times about but that doesn’t just occur here. As a home owner with Duke I can tell you everyone with Duke experiences what you have but they have the monopoly as the only option for electric services.
We completely understand the concerns for changes, we were unsure at first but after seeing the upgrades to the space and the furniture packages, the price difference is low for what is being offered, not only inside the apartment but also the soon to come community upgrades, especially the two level fitness center. I am sure if you called around and compared the new rates per square foot and the rates of various properties per square foot you will find we are still very competitive and come in lower per sq feet plus when you add in the location to the stadium and the property amenities.
Again the changes may not be positive for all and we can empathize with that but we have had a record renewal year and are pre-leased 16% higher right now than last year at this time so the offerings, upgrades and even pricing is appealing to many current and future residents living preferences and that is what we want to make sure we are able to do, offer modern apartments as well as remaining competitive in the market.
We hope you stop by for our next event where we will be grilling and hopefully for our opening pool party in May where we will have BBQ.

Well, after she moved in, please just look at the pictures my gf sent to me. (Update: I uploaded 8 photos but I do not know why it is only showing 2 of them). No more words needed. They insisted this is “livable”. Are you kidding me? Man, I’m not paying that amount of rent for a “livable” place!

Thank you for reaching out. We do care about our past residents as well as the living standers of our future. We do charge for damages done by past residents and expect them to be good care takers of the unit. As you said you had fleas but didn’t report them until one week prior to move out. Our vendor was unable to come prior to your move out as we told you and as you did not want to take fleas to your new apartment you made the choice to have extermination done. It was clear the exterminator that you hired was not efficient as the flea infestation was not exterminated. To ensure our future residents did not move into a flea infestation.
The parking pass for each year you were here was $30 per vehicle per year which is very reasonable. The administration fee is not a hidden fee, as it is listed clearly on the lease. It is $100.00 per person per year.

I understand they try and help, but their help isn’t in a timely manner. Maintenance here is not organized at all. My dad had to write a strongly worded email just to get our washer a dryer replaced after 4 weeks of going back and forth with management. Then, they finally replaced it. Next, our dishwasher decided it didn’t want to run anymore so we put in a maintenance request. This time, the maintenance guy came the next day and said he would be back tomorrow to replace it. He never showed. A week went by and he never came. My roommate and I called the office to say we put in a request and it was never fixed. They told us that they don’t deal with that and that we have to put in another request, so we did. A week and a half went by and no one came to replace it still. It is now week 4 and I called on saturday to ask what was taking so long. they said they would text him and to have him come first thing monday morning. There was no show so I called them again. I was told yet again to put in another request. So I did. Although they keep stating that they don’t deal with it, they don’t put in much effort to make this happen quickly. I would not recommend signing here, as I will never again. Go somewhere that will fix your issues with the apartment faster. That, or they need to hire more maintenance people so tenants can be satisfied and that they can compete jobs in a timely manner. Indiana Law states that apartments must have appliances in good and working condition that encourages us to sign a lease. However, this is certainly not true here. On top of that, the pictures on the website are false advertising. We don’t have a workout place with equipment. The apartment complex is also not white on the outside. It needs to be stated somewhere that it’s not quite there yet. They also need to give tenants a timeline so we can know when to expect a gym.

A complete scam. Parking permit rates went from yearly passes, to semester passes, and increased in price from $30/year to $40/semester. The management seems nice and helpful, but it is a ploy to get you to sign here.  They do not prorate, and leases almost never start and end on the first of the month (when they expect rent). So, if you move in on the 12th of whatever month, you still have to pay for the entire month even though you will only be living there for about half of the month.

And the same goes for moving out. My move out day is the 11th of the month, and they are making me pay for the entire month regardless of having paid for a full month when I moved in, and regardless of me actually being in the apartment for less than half of the month. So, basically they expect an EXTRA full month's rent outside of the time that you will actually be staying in the apartment. And ending the lease earlier on the 1st of the month is obviously not an option, as they will charge a $600 lease-breaking fee.

They have recently updated a lot of things, like turning the two-bed into 3-beds, decreasing the size of the dog park to make room for an adult-like jungle-gym that is never used, and other cosmetic things that hardly help the community. They added an extra person to each of the two-bed to 3-bed converts, raised the prices for each room, and did not bother to add space to any of these units, or extra parking for the additional people expected to be living on the property. This place is an absolute scam. Also, they are BIG on towing, and visitors parking, and non-permit parking is far and few between after 6-7 P.M.

This place sucks for what they try to make you pay. Please DO NOT SIGN HERE.

Also, read all the responses to some of the reviews posted here. As you can see, often the management person replying to some of these reviews gets a little snappy defending the property, and these are instances to take into consideration. And another thing to consider, some people who are living here, and say that they ""LOOOOOVE it!"" are often people who have come in AFTER some of the renovations and price inflations, so they do not know that they are being scammed. Some people are fine paying more for mediocrity, but as someone who supports herself financially, I refuse to get less than what I am paying for by staying another year.

Something I find funny about this place is that, as a resident of about 3 three years, the first time i renewed I was able to do another year lease, which is ideal as a college student. However, this last time I renewed my lease, I was only allowed to do so and keep my same unit (and rental rate) if I signed a 10 month lease as opposed to a 12. This means that I have to be moved out of my apartment just a week after graduation, which sucks time wise. Being that there is predominantly college students living on this property, you would think that this is something they would take into consideration.

I was told that I had to sign a 10-month lease because the following year (2019-2020) there would be NO MORE 2-bed units. But guess what?! Just a couple weeks ago, I get a notice on my door, asking me to extend my lease from May to the end of July--what would have originally been the end of my lease, had they not been so eager to get rid of the people who KNOW what they old prices were BEFORE they started ""upgrading"" (more like down-grading) everything. Honestly none of the ""upgrades"" they have done are worth the inflation.

AN ABSOLUTE TERRIBLE PLACE TO LIVE (if your mom and dad aren't paying for everything)",,,,,"Hello, Congrats on graduating! I’m sorry that in your 3 years that you were a resident, your rental rates went up. I assure you that if you call any area apartment, you would find the same thing, as rates increase. You would also find our parking to be cheaper, especially being located so close to the stadium, and rental prices being lower than area comps.  As for your lease, if you chose to release, the fee is not $600, and is clearly outlined in your signed lease, as well as the amount for the full months rent.

Thats just what tipped the bucket this is easily the worst place I have ever lived.

“In regards to the pest issue we have advised you before that so long as your trash bags are taken out regularly rather than being left in the apartment kitchen and closet for a long time that you will not continue to have this issue with gnats and ants.”

As I never received any response about the ants and gnats I’m not sure who you told this to. However, trash has never been the issue. The kitchen and living area, which are the only places food is present in my apartment, are the only places there has not been an ant problem.
As I said, ants come through the wall separating my apartment from the adjacent unit. I have watched the ants come under the wall between the bathtub and toilet. Ants also come in through the wall in the bedroom where I also do not store or eat food or leave food waste. I regularly vacuum and clean the floor. I do have a trashcan in my bathroom which I empty regularly, as I do with the trash in the kitchen. I have never in my life kept trash in the closet.
When I moved in there was a cloud of gnats in the apartment which I took care of along with the other health and cleanliness issues present at move in.
I was out of the country for the summer so before I left I took the trash out and everything was clean and bug free. When I returned, there were gnats and ants again. As my apartment was empty the entire summer, there was still no trash present upon my return. So, in the absence of myself, food, or trash, the pest issue reappeared.
In regards to your smoke detector battery, maintenance provided you a battery free of charge so that your smoke detector would work then.”

Yes this was explained by the staff member in May. What is problematic is that when maintenance was sent months later, he said he was there to replace a battery that I had requested. This request was in May, so that was either a big delay in response or miscommunication, both of which have been cornerstones of my experiences as a resident.
ORIGINAL REVIEW:
The wifi is terrible; at times it does not work at all. It's pretty dirty and they cater primarily to pets. Not people. The office is the only place to get packages and they have very limited hours. If you have classes or work during the day you will have to skip to get your package because they only hold the package for around 5 days. They are also not open at all on weekends. So if you were planning to have things delivered Saturday it won't happen. The apartments are very poorly constructed too. It's very overpriced for cheap materials and shoddy construction. The counters are separating from the wall because the sealant was so poorly done. In the kitchen and bathroom. There is also a problem with ants and gnats. I notified the apartment that ants were coming in through the bathroom wall from the apartment behind and nothing was done about it. I had to handle it. I also had to handle many other problems when I moved in, the highlights of which include thick coats of dust on all the ceiling and wall vents which indicates there's probably some type of circulation problem, mold behind the washing machine, muddy water coming up from the bathtub drain, and an army of gnats. The response time is like that for a lot of things. For example, there was an inspection in May where they found my smoke detector alarm wasn't working. One of the maintenance men gave me a new battery, but the management wasn't aware of this. A week or two prior to the next inspection, which was in August or September, someone came saying there was a report I needed a battery for my smoke detector. This is how most issues are handled here.",,,,,"Hello Ms Solkey,
Please allow us to address your concerns. The internet has been upgraded as of 9/14/16 and you would have had a letter in the mail about picking up a new modem which will increase upload and download speeds. You are also welcome to make sure that package deliveries for you go directly to your door through your delivery instructions, they do not have to bring them to the office. Package receiving is also not a service that we are obliged to offer but that we do as an amenity. We only hold for five days due to the space of the office and the number of packages that we receive which we believe is ample time given to pick up a valuable item. The office hours change seasonally and during the month of September the office was closed on weekends. In regards to the pest issue we have advised you before that so long as your trash bags are taken out regularly rather than being left in the apartment kitchen and closet for a long time that you will not continue to have this issue with gnats and ants. In regards to your smoke detector battery, maintenance provided you a battery free of charge so that your smoke detector would work then. The visit before the inspection was to ensure that you did not once again remove the battery so that we could check you as complaint.

I'll write this in list form to better organize everything.

1. Campus Court advertises free TV and Internet (included in your rent). It was one of the things that made me decide to live here. I moved in right after the school year ended and lived there over the summer (when it was basically deserted because it is mainly student housing). When I first moved in, the internet was spotty at best, but it worked outside of high-traffic times when everyone was on. However, once school started up and everyone moved back in, the internet did not work. At all. Ever. This is completely false advertising on Campus Court's part. DO NOT fall into this trap. I had to get my own internet outside of the (already overpriced) rent.

2. The cable that came with the apartment was decent. The only complaint that I have is that the cable jack that was in the wall did not work. Therefore, I had to have Comcast come out to my apartment to set up the cable. Campus Court said that it should be good to go after you pick up the box from Comcast and plug it into the wall. Wrong. So when the guy came out to set up the TV, he said that at least half of the jacks in the walls at CC don't work and that his only option was to run the cable all the way across the living room and hallway to plug the cable into the jack that was located in the coat closet. I lived in a unit with hardwood floors, so the cable couldn't be hidden. It also had to cross a hallway and was a HUGE safety hazard/fall risk. I don't know how many times people fell over that cable. When I went to management they said that they wouldn't fix the problem. That was it- discussion closed. Next thing I knew, I received a bill for $100 from Comcast for the site visit that was needed to set up my cable. Even though it was Campus Court's fault that I needed a technician to come anyway, they refused to pay the bill.

3. I lived on the upper floor at Campus Court. The stairs to the apartment were falling apart. Every time someone would walk up, the set of stairs would shake to the point that I was afraid that the entire thing was going to fall over. On top of this, several of the boards in my stairs were starting to crack in half. I went to management to see what could be done. They said they would get the stairs fixed. Months later, nothing had been done. One day I was on my way down and the board on the step cracked in half. I fell all the way down the stairs. I immediately went to the office, and they had their handyman replace the one board that broke- even though there were several that needed it.  This was an ongoing battle that I never won. However, I have to say that the maintenance crew here is comprised of two of the nicest men I've met. They are awesome.

4. Finally, when I moved out, my room mate and I forgot about $500 worth of winter coats in the coat closet. We didn't realize until about 2 months after we moved out, as we moved out at the beginning of summer. I called Campus Court to inquire if they had been found and was completely stonewalled. The man that answered the phone said he would ""ask around"" and get back to me. I still hadn't heard anything a week later, so I called back. The woman that answered the phone this time said that per the lease, I had one month to pick up any forgotten items. Campus Court had ALL of my information including my phone number and forwarding address. But they certainly did not have the decency to give me a call saying I had forgotten everything that was in my coat closet. Instead, they let time run out of time so that someone could take it home without giving me the chance to reclaim my things.

For the location, the rent was ridiculously high. The staff were not helpful and were often exceedingly rude. You can find an apartment in a much better location for a better price.",,,,,,,,https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURRM1BpemxnRRAB!2m1!1s0x0:0x54817981dac47e66!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgIDQ3PizlgE%7CCgsItorIpAUQwKnTOg%7C?hl=en-US,1,1418855734,12/17/2014 22:35:34,3,6089281769809673830,60,4,8,16,103

They made it look like we were getting a deal until you see everything they add on to the price. Also with the huge parking lot (which Bloomington lacks) your still unable to get parking because they ran out of parking passes. What kind of place wouldn't make enough parking passes for all their residents. As a resident they are making me parking in visitors (which is always full because there is very little of it) or at the Great Wall Chinese Restaurant. Or they said I can pay $30 a month for VIP parking. $360 dollars to park because you guys ran out?! On top of that the wifi is terrible. Good luck being an IU student and trying to do your homework here. The management is not helpful into trying to help you out. They say they accommodate to IU students. Well I'm an IU student and I'm not being accommodated! I'm moving asap.,,,,,"Hello Ms. Teegarden,
We thank you for being a renewing resident and apologize for your experience. In efforts to better explain we have 277 parking spaces, which includes visitor spaces, and 333 beds. We only sell 250 parking passes to allow for visitor parking space to be available to our residents’ guests.

The property was built for students housing and therefore it was designed assuming that not every residents would have a vehicle. Parking passes were made available on 8/1/16 for $30 per pass for the 16-17 lease year. This fee helps fund the cleanup of the grounds and road repair work that is done annually. As all passes are sold first come first serve, when you returned to purchase your pass in September all general $30 passes had been purchased as we are highly occupied this year due to better rates and additional amenities.

This only leaves the option to park in the neighboring restaurant parking area and visitor parking for anyone without a pass. The only other onsite option at this time was 1 of the 10 reserved parking of $30 a month, so roughly a $1 day to know you have an exact space coming and going daily.

We also accommodate any residents who meet our background and credit check history, not just students. Our statement was that we are student housing when we were making efforts to explain why parking spaces were less that the number of beds, not everyone is expected to have a car. Please also know that the parking space count and buildings do meet city codes and most complexes close to the IU campus do not have the same number of parking spaces as beds.

They are rude, and they treat people poorly.

Do yourself a favor, find another place to rent, or you will be stuck with a poorly-managed property of sub-par accommodations.",,,,,"Hello,
In efforts to explain the 16-17 lease we wanted to reply to your concerns. The lease is set up for full monthly instalments rather than rent which is often prorated the first or last month and a more common practice of multi-family housing rather than student housing. This helps keep the monthly cost lower and dispersed among the 10 or 12 month lease. Our move outs are set yearly to end 7/31 which allows two weeks for turnover of the apartment, paint, cleaning and carpet cleaning or floor repair allowing for the best move in experience possible.
This is explained to all prospects or lease applicants prior to signing the lease. For those who sign a lease online the rent installments is listed on the front page with monthly payment schedule calendar. We hope that the signers communicates this with their parent and or guarantor however we understand that the residents may want to live here and they may choose to overlook sharing this fact so their parent and or guarantor does not re-direct them to live elsewhere.

We are not showing you as a residents or parent in our system and I am certain we have never spoken. We did just have a review created on Facebook similar to yours but under a different name of a parent guarantor. I’m certainly not assuming this is a Gmail account created for the sole purpose to continue to slander us and therefore I want to address your concerns.
As a response to your review please allow us to explain to our readers. We would invite all to drive through and review the property appearance on any day or time for themselves. Mass move in can result the trash receptacles being full to the point that the refuse will not fit in the corral but when our servicers come the next day we ask them to do multiple lifts to clear the corral receptacles. Again, we would invite all those interested in leasing with us to drive and walk the property, stop and speak with residents and ask questions of their experiences. Please know if this is indeed related to that other review I ask that you do not confuse costumer service for continuing to accept verbal abuse and threats made to our employees and allow that action to continue.
I certainly invite you Mr. Gallagher to stop by so we can reach your expectations and formally meet.

But when it gets snowy its impossible getting into the parking lot without sliding.   A bag of ice melt for each entrance would suffice.,,,,,"Thank you for your review. We are glad you are enjoying living here and trust me, the staff hates this weather when driving as much as everyone else as we have to come and go too. We do our best to maintain our property. Sidewalks are maintained by maintenance and roads by the plow company we partner with. Unfortunately, the entrances are past our property lines and maintained by the city, not us, neighboring apartments that use the drive, the hotel or the restaurant that also shares that drive, but by the city. They have to be maintained by the city, which is the same reason you do not see plow trucks dropping their plow on roads to just help out, because they cannot, they could be held liable for doing so. Salting does help with ice and some snow but at this depth and daily temperature would make little to no impact. We have however put in requests with the city so that these roads do not go serviced. Any member of the public can so do by going to, https://bloomington.in.gov/ureport . Stay safe and warm this winter season.

First off, I was able to schedule to view the Standard’s sample room which was staged at the leasing office. My mom and I went, and were feeling very discouraged due to the experience at the previous property we had checked out, but right when we entered we knew it was going to get better.

Right when we entered the room, I was greeted by name and was offered to see a virtual fly through of the property and get some questions answered. We asked all the questions we could think of at the time, and were even offered answers to questions we hadn’t even thought of at the time.

We looked around the staged room and it was very spacious and inviting. All the appliances were brand new and we even found out the fridge in the staging office is actually getting an upgrade in the actual units.

We left feeling hopeful but still had more properties to look at, so we left, however at the end of the day we knew we wanted to apply at the standard. I texted and asked about returning to the leasing office the following day to finalize a few questions we had and they were able to get us in.

We entered again and started to ask more questions, and ended up filling out the lease that day.

They were able to get a parkingspot added to my lease very easily, and that is a huge bonus as around campus parking is hard to come by.

With the building being built on 14th street it is a 10 minute walk from Kelly, and 10th street so Its very convenient even to walk down there,
Though we were told there will also be a bus stop for the standard as well.

Its definitely worth renting here, with how on top of everything they are I’m looking forward to living there next year.

The other reviews here have to be fake, as living here is an absolute nightmare. It is an active construction zone, meaning you will be woken up at 7am daily to the noise of construction. The wifi is down constantly and it is a dead zone for cell service making it impossible to do homework in your own home. The units look nice but the construction is rushed and shoddy. For example my unit has holes in the floor and walls which led to an ant infestation. Management took over 2 weeks to respond to repeated emails and emergency maintenance requests about this and by the time they responded I had already spent $200 on my own pest control services. Currently my washing machine has been broken for the past 10 days and management has no response. Do not expect any maintenance at all. There’s always trash everywhere from residents and construction workers alike and many things are broken due to the poor quality of construction. Rent here is not worth the high cost and the management team is composed of nice but ultimately absolutely useless individuals who do nothing to solve the constant problems. The location is excellent and amenities are nice, but take your money elsewhere if you want a stress free living experience.",,,,,"Thank you so much for your feedback.

Those certain residents should be punished/monetarily penalized and not everyone else who lives here. There was only notice of the pool closing but the hot tub was advertised as year round. This is unacceptable. On top of this, we pay more than Verve property and do not have a private bus. My walk to school everyday is > 30 minutes and I am dreading it in winter. A bus only coming every hour is not practical and doesn’t work for students. No one wants to show up an hour before their class time. Also the package room is a mess and packages constantly missing or lost. Also a huge safety hazard for heavy packages on the top shelf for smaller residents to grab. Should be individual lockers opening each resident to his or her own package. Lastly, people here need to respect their neighbors and quiet down past 1-2am.

After paying so much there should be a separate bus just for standard.. Verve had communicated the bus routes days prior along with times and the expectation was for Standard to do the same due to similar price rates on rent. On top of that move in was very late (two days before school started) and very stressful. Two days was certainly not enough time to move in and it was too crowded. The wifi has also been super slow and it has been challenging to do any academic work. The biggest disappointment was the false advertising all around and no cherry blossoms trees by the pool. Lastly, move in was delayed so late that the last expectation was for at least everything to be completed at the buildings which it was not.",,,,,Thank you for taking the time to leave a review.

Not a good place to live. It’s very expensive and with a lot of the amenities are no longer available (locked doors, closed down despite being “year round”, and under construction) it’s not really worth it.

The walls are very very thin— if you’re in your room or living room you can hear people in the halls yelling, talking, and throwing things at all hours of the night.

The package room is a mess and bigger packages are stored out in the open in a shared room, if your package goes missing they won’t do anything to help/ reimburse you.

There is constant LOUD construction that starts almost everyday at 6-8 am until 5-7 pm.

My biggest issue is the wi-fi. The wi-fi goes out a few times a week for multiple hours, so if you have homework or studying, you have to set up a hotspot or go somewhere else.

The Standard’s management is constantly “working on” fixing these issues but it never actually happens.",,,,,"Hey Elena, thank you for your review.

Here's my list of reasons why.
1. They shut down our year-round hot tub and closed off all our outside amenities. We explicitly moved from Verve with the guarantee that the hot tub would be year-round. We pay a lot of money in rent for the amenities. We want to use them.
2. The Wi-Fi sucks. It goes out constantly. I am a fulltime student and part time remote employee. This cannot happen.
3. We need our own bus as it gets colder. It has been told to us that it can easily be done yet hasn't been despite multiple requests from residents.
4. There has been loud construction outside all year!
5. Male maintenance man came into our apartment and woke up female residents. This is inappropriate and a safety concern. No woman wants to wake up to a strange man outside their door. Just because you sent a notice saying this is going to happen in a span of four days does not prepare residents for this. Give a specific time on a specific day so residents can be prepared. If I was a parent, I would not want my daughter to live somewhere where this happens without adequate notice.
6. It frequently smells terrible in the hallways.
7. The package system is a disaster. I never get notified when my packages come. Therefore, it is hard for me to get my packages. I have had many missing packages. Everything about the package system is a headache.
8. Any problem is run through a third party. It is hard to ever get help.
9. Whenever we make suggestions or complaints, we are met with an unfriendly response. I am extremely disappointed with management here.",,,,,Thank you for your feedback.
